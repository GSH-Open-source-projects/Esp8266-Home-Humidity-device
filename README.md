This is a project for designing one Humidity control by Esp8266 MCU

We are using the Arduino IDE so you need to add ESP8266 boot library to it by this instruction.


These project contain these parts:

1- Temperature,Humidity, water level and ... Sensors part ( using HR202 or DHT11 & ... ) with ESP8266 MCU.
2- Ultrasonic Power Driver.
3- Power-supply for it.
4- Designing one beautiful Plastic CAD or use the ordinary Traditional container like [this][1].

SO As we are doing on it we update this project.

For the first part of it i have tried the DHT11 sensor and RL202 sensor which the RL202  reading failed by this codes and the DHT11 try have been successful as shown below:

Also we have one [telegram group][3] for more communication about this project for our self.

Thanks for your attention.
